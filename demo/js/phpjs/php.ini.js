var PHP_ini = "[PHP]\n\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;\n; About php.ini   ;\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;\n; PHP's initialization file, generally called php.ini, is responsible for\n; configuring many of the aspects of PHP's behavior.\n\n; PHP attempts to find and load this configuration from a number of locations.\n; The following is a summary of its search order:\n; 1. SAPI module specific location.\n; 2. The PHPRC environment variable. (As of PHP 5.2.0)\n; 3. A number of predefined registry keys on Windows (As of PHP 5.2.0)\n; 4. Current working directory (except CLI)\n; 5. The web server's directory (for SAPI modules), or directory of PHP\n; (otherwise in Windows)\n; 6. The directory from the --with-config-file-path compile time option, or the\n; Windows directory (C:\\windows or C:\\winnt)\n; See the PHP docs for more specific information.\n; http://php.net/configuration.file\n\n; The syntax of the file is extremely simple.  Whitespace and Lines\n; beginning with a semicolon are silently ignored (as you probably guessed).\n; Section headers (e.g. [Foo]) are also silently ignored, even though\n; they might mean something in the future.\n\n; Directives following the section heading [PATH=/www/mysite] only\n; apply to PHP files in the /www/mysite directory.  Directives\n; following the section heading [HOST=www.example.com] only apply to\n; PHP files served from www.example.com.  Directives set in these\n; special sections cannot be overridden by user-defined INI files or\n; at runtime. Currently, [PATH=] and [HOST=] sections only work under\n; CGI/FastCGI.\n; http://php.net/ini.sections\n\n; Directives are specified using the following syntax:\n; directive = value\n; Directive names are *case sensitive* - foo=bar is different from FOO=bar.\n; Directives are variables used to configure PHP or PHP extensions.\n; There is no name validation.  If PHP can't find an expected\n; directive because it is not set or is mistyped, a default value will be used.\n\n; The value can be a string, a number, a PHP constant (e.g. E_ALL or M_PI), one\n; of the INI constants (On, Off, True, False, Yes, No and None) or an expression\n; (e.g. E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE), a quoted string (\"bar\"), or a reference to a\n; previously set variable or directive (e.g. ${foo})\n\n; Expressions in the INI file are limited to bitwise operators and parentheses:\n; |  bitwise OR\n; ^  bitwise XOR\n; &  bitwise AND\n; ~  bitwise NOT\n; !  boolean NOT\n\n; Boolean flags can be turned on using the values 1, On, True or Yes.\n; They can be turned off using the values 0, Off, False or No.\n\n; An empty string can be denoted by simply not writing anything after the equal\n; sign, or by using the None keyword:\n\n;  foo =         ; sets foo to an empty string\n;  foo = None    ; sets foo to an empty string\n;  foo = \"None\"  ; sets foo to the string 'None'\n\n; If you use constants in your value, and these constants belong to a\n; dynamically loaded extension (either a PHP extension or a Zend extension),\n; you may only use these constants *after* the line that loads the extension.\n\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;\n; About this file ;\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;\n; PHP comes packaged with two INI files. One that is recommended to be used\n; in production environments and one that is recommended to be used in\n; development environments.\n\n; php.ini-production contains settings which hold security, performance and\n; best practices at its core. But please be aware, these settings may break\n; compatibility with older or less security conscience applications. We\n; recommending using the production ini in production and testing environments.\n\n; php.ini-development is very similar to its production variant, except it's\n; much more verbose when it comes to errors. We recommending using the\n; development version only in development environments as errors shown to\n; application users can inadvertently leak otherwise secure information.\n\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;\n; Quick Reference ;\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;\n; The following are all the settings which are different in either the production\n; or development versions of the INIs with respect to PHP's default behavior.\n; Please see the actual settings later in the document for more details as to why\n; we recommend these changes in PHP's behavior.\n\n; display_errors\n;   Default Value: On\n;   Development Value: On\n;   Production Value: Off\n\n; display_startup_errors\n;   Default Value: Off\n;   Development Value: On\n;   Production Value: Off\n\n; error_reporting\n;   Default Value: E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE & ~E_STRICT & ~E_DEPRECATED\n;   Development Value: E_ALL\n;   Production Value: E_ALL & ~E_DEPRECATED & ~E_STRICT\n\n; html_errors\n;   Default Value: On\n;   Development Value: On\n;   Production value: On\n\n; log_errors\n;   Default Value: Off\n;   Development Value: On\n;   Production Value: On\n\n; max_input_time\n;   Default Value: -1 (Unlimited)\n;   Development Value: 60 (60 seconds)\n;   Production Value: 60 (60 seconds)\n\n; output_buffering\n;   Default Value: Off\n;   Development Value: 4096\n;   Production Value: 4096\n\n; register_argc_argv\n;   Default Value: On\n;   Development Value: Off\n;   Production Value: Off\n\n; request_order\n;   Default Value: None\n;   Development Value: \"GP\"\n;   Production Value: \"GP\"\n\n; session.bug_compat_42\n;   Default Value: On\n;   Development Value: On\n;   Production Value: Off\n\n; session.bug_compat_warn\n;   Default Value: On\n;   Development Value: On\n;   Production Value: Off\n\n; session.gc_divisor\n;   Default Value: 100\n;   Development Value: 1000\n;   Production Value: 1000\n\n; session.hash_bits_per_character\n;   Default Value: 4\n;   Development Value: 5\n;   Production Value: 5\n\n; short_open_tag\n;   Default Value: On\n;   Development Value: Off\n;   Production Value: Off\n\n; track_errors\n;   Default Value: Off\n;   Development Value: On\n;   Production Value: Off\n\n; url_rewriter.tags\n;   Default Value: \"a=href,area=href,frame=src,form=,fieldset=\"\n;   Development Value: \"a=href,area=href,frame=src,input=src,form=fakeentry\"\n;   Production Value: \"a=href,area=href,frame=src,input=src,form=fakeentry\"\n\n; variables_order\n;   Default Value: \"EGPCS\"\n;   Development Value: \"GPCS\"\n;   Production Value: \"GPCS\"\n\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;\n; php.ini Options  ;\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;\n; Name for user-defined php.ini (.htaccess) files. Default is \".user.ini\"\n;user_ini.filename = \".user.ini\"\n\n; To disable this feature set this option to empty value\n;user_ini.filename =\n\n; TTL for user-defined php.ini files (time-to-live) in seconds. Default is 300 seconds (5 minutes)\n;user_ini.cache_ttl = 300\n\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;\n; Language Options ;\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;\n\n; Enable the PHP scripting language engine under Apache.\n; http://php.net/engine\nengine = On\n\n; This directive determines whether or not PHP will recognize code between\n; <? and ?> tags as PHP source which should be processed as such. It's been\n; recommended for several years that you not use the short tag \"short cut\" and\n; instead to use the full <?php and ?> tag combination. With the wide spread use\n; of XML and use of these tags by other languages, the server can become easily\n; confused and end up parsing the wrong code in the wrong context. But because\n; this short cut has been a feature for such a long time, it's currently still\n; supported for backwards compatibility, but we recommend you don't use them.\n; Default Value: On\n; Development Value: Off\n; Production Value: Off\n; http://php.net/short-open-tag\nshort_open_tag = Off\n\n; Allow ASP-style <% %> tags.\n; http://php.net/asp-tags\nasp_tags = Off\n\n; The number of significant digits displayed in floating point numbers.\n; http://php.net/precision\nprecision = 14\n\n; Output buffering is a mechanism for controlling how much output data\n; (excluding headers and cookies) PHP should keep internally before pushing that\n; data to the client. If your application's output exceeds this setting, PHP\n; will send that data in chunks of roughly the size you specify.\n; Turning on this setting and managing its maximum buffer size can yield some\n; interesting side-effects depending on your application and web server.\n; You may be able to send headers and cookies after you've already sent output\n; through print or echo. You also may see performance benefits if your server is\n; emitting less packets due to buffered output versus PHP streaming the output\n; as it gets it. On production servers, 4096 bytes is a good setting for performance\n; reasons.\n; Note: Output buffering can also be controlled via Output Buffering Control\n;   functions.\n; Possible Values:\n;   On = Enabled and buffer is unlimited. (Use with caution)\n;   Off = Disabled\n;   Integer = Enables the buffer and sets its maximum size in bytes.\n; Note: This directive is hardcoded to Off for the CLI SAPI\n; Default Value: Off\n; Development Value: 4096\n; Production Value: 4096\n; http://php.net/output-buffering\noutput_buffering = 4096\n\n; You can redirect all of the output of your scripts to a function.  For\n; example, if you set output_handler to \"mb_output_handler\", character\n; encoding will be transparently converted to the specified encoding.\n; Setting any output handler automatically turns on output buffering.\n; Note: People who wrote portable scripts should not depend on this ini\n;   directive. Instead, explicitly set the output handler using ob_start().\n;   Using this ini directive may cause problems unless you know what script\n;   is doing.\n; Note: You cannot use both \"mb_output_handler\" with \"ob_iconv_handler\"\n;   and you cannot use both \"ob_gzhandler\" and \"zlib.output_compression\".\n; Note: output_handler must be empty if this is set 'On' !!!!\n;   Instead you must use zlib.output_handler.\n; http://php.net/output-handler\n;output_handler =\n\n; Transparent output compression using the zlib library\n; Valid values for this option are 'off', 'on', or a specific buffer size\n; to be used for compression (default is 4KB)\n; Note: Resulting chunk size may vary due to nature of compression. PHP\n;   outputs chunks that are few hundreds bytes each as a result of\n;   compression. If you prefer a larger chunk size for better\n;   performance, enable output_buffering in addition.\n; Note: You need to use zlib.output_handler instead of the standard\n;   output_handler, or otherwise the output will be corrupted.\n; http://php.net/zlib.output-compression\nzlib.output_compression = Off\n\n; http://php.net/zlib.output-compression-level\n;zlib.output_compression_level = -1\n\n; You cannot specify additional output handlers if zlib.output_compression\n; is activated here. This setting does the same as output_handler but in\n; a different order.\n; http://php.net/zlib.output-handler\n;zlib.output_handler =\n\n; Implicit flush tells PHP to tell the output layer to flush itself\n; automatically after every output block.  This is equivalent to calling the\n; PHP function flush() after each and every call to print() or echo() and each\n; and every HTML block.  Turning this option on has serious performance\n; implications and is generally recommended for debugging purposes only.\n; http://php.net/implicit-flush\n; Note: This directive is hardcoded to On for the CLI SAPI\nimplicit_flush = Off\n\n; The unserialize callback function will be called (with the undefined class'\n; name as parameter), if the unserializer finds an undefined class\n; which should be instantiated. A warning appears if the specified function is\n; not defined, or if the function doesn't include/implement the missing class.\n; So only set this entry, if you really want to implement such a\n; callback-function.\nunserialize_callback_func =\n\n; When floats & doubles are serialized store serialize_precision significant\n; digits after the floating point. The default value ensures that when floats\n; are decoded with unserialize, the data will remain the same.\nserialize_precision = 17\n\n; open_basedir, if set, limits all file operations to the defined directory\n; and below.  This directive makes most sense if used in a per-directory\n; or per-virtualhost web server configuration file. This directive is\n; *NOT* affected by whether Safe Mode is turned On or Off.\n; http://php.net/open-basedir\n;open_basedir =\n\n; This directive allows you to disable certain functions for security reasons.\n; It receives a comma-delimited list of function names. This directive is\n; *NOT* affected by whether Safe Mode is turned On or Off.\n; http://php.net/disable-functions\ndisable_functions =\n\n; This directive allows you to disable certain classes for security reasons.\n; It receives a comma-delimited list of class names. This directive is\n; *NOT* affected by whether Safe Mode is turned On or Off.\n; http://php.net/disable-classes\ndisable_classes =\n\n; Colors for Syntax Highlighting mode.  Anything that's acceptable in\n; <span style=\"color: ???????\"> would work.\n; http://php.net/syntax-highlighting\n;highlight.string  = #DD0000\n;highlight.comment = #FF9900\n;highlight.keyword = #007700\n;highlight.default = #0000BB\n;highlight.html    = #000000\n\n; If enabled, the request will be allowed to complete even if the user aborts\n; the request. Consider enabling it if executing long requests, which may end up\n; being interrupted by the user or a browser timing out. PHP's default behavior\n; is to disable this feature.\n; http://php.net/ignore-user-abort\n;ignore_user_abort = On\n\n; Determines the size of the realpath cache to be used by PHP. This value should\n; be increased on systems where PHP opens many files to reflect the quantity of\n; the file operations performed.\n; http://php.net/realpath-cache-size\n;realpath_cache_size = 16k\n\n; Duration of time, in seconds for which to cache realpath information for a given\n; file or directory. For systems with rarely changing files, consider increasing this\n; value.\n; http://php.net/realpath-cache-ttl\n;realpath_cache_ttl = 120\n\n; Enables or disables the circular reference collector.\n; http://php.net/zend.enable-gc\nzend.enable_gc = On\n\n; If enabled, scripts may be written in encodings that are incompatible with\n; the scanner.  CP936, Big5, CP949 and Shift_JIS are the examples of such\n; encodings.  To use this feature, mbstring extension must be enabled.\n; Default: Off\n;zend.multibyte = Off\n\n; Allows to set the default encoding for the scripts.  This value will be used\n; unless \"declare(encoding=...)\" directive appears at the top of the script.\n; Only affects if zend.multibyte is set.\n; Default: \"\"\n;zend.script_encoding =\n\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;\n; Miscellaneous ;\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;\n\n; Decides whether PHP may expose the fact that it is installed on the server\n; (e.g. by adding its signature to the Web server header).  It is no security\n; threat in any way, but it makes it possible to determine whether you use PHP\n; on your server or not.\n; http://php.net/expose-php\nexpose_php = On\n\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;\n; Resource Limits ;\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;\n\n; Maximum execution time of each script, in seconds\n; http://php.net/max-execution-time\n; Note: This directive is hardcoded to 0 for the CLI SAPI\nmax_execution_time = 30\n\n; Maximum amount of time each script may spend parsing request data. It's a good\n; idea to limit this time on productions servers in order to eliminate unexpectedly\n; long running scripts.\n; Note: This directive is hardcoded to -1 for the CLI SAPI\n; Default Value: -1 (Unlimited)\n; Development Value: 60 (60 seconds)\n; Production Value: 60 (60 seconds)\n; http://php.net/max-input-time\nmax_input_time = 60\n\n; Maximum input variable nesting level\n; http://php.net/max-input-nesting-level\n;max_input_nesting_level = 64\n\n; How many GET/POST/COOKIE input variables may be accepted\n; max_input_vars = 1000\n\n; Maximum amount of memory a script may consume (128MB)\n; http://php.net/memory-limit\nmemory_limit = 128M\n\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;\n; Error handling and logging ;\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;\n\n; This directive informs PHP of which errors, warnings and notices you would like\n; it to take action for. The recommended way of setting values for this\n; directive is through the use of the error level constants and bitwise\n; operators. The error level constants are below here for convenience as well as\n; some common settings and their meanings.\n; By default, PHP is set to take action on all errors, notices and warnings EXCEPT\n; those related to E_NOTICE and E_STRICT, which together cover best practices and\n; recommended coding standards in PHP. For performance reasons, this is the\n; recommend error reporting setting. Your production server shouldn't be wasting\n; resources complaining about best practices and coding standards. That's what\n; development servers and development settings are for.\n; Note: The php.ini-development file has this setting as E_ALL. This\n; means it pretty much reports everything which is exactly what you want during\n; development and early testing.\n;\n; Error Level Constants:\n; E_ALL             - All errors and warnings (includes E_STRICT as of PHP 5.4.0)\n; E_ERROR           - fatal run-time errors\n; E_RECOVERABLE_ERROR  - almost fatal run-time errors\n; E_WARNING         - run-time warnings (non-fatal errors)\n; E_PARSE           - compile-time parse errors\n; E_NOTICE          - run-time notices (these are warnings which often result\n;                     from a bug in your code, but it's possible that it was\n;                     intentional (e.g., using an uninitialized variable and\n;                     relying on the fact it's automatically initialized to an\n;                     empty string)\n; E_STRICT          - run-time notices, enable to have PHP suggest changes\n;                     to your code which will ensure the best interoperability\n;                     and forward compatibility of your code\n; E_CORE_ERROR      - fatal errors that occur during PHP's initial startup\n; E_CORE_WARNING    - warnings (non-fatal errors) that occur during PHP's\n;                     initial startup\n; E_COMPILE_ERROR   - fatal compile-time errors\n; E_COMPILE_WARNING - compile-time warnings (non-fatal errors)\n; E_USER_ERROR      - user-generated error message\n; E_USER_WARNING    - user-generated warning message\n; E_USER_NOTICE     - user-generated notice message\n; E_DEPRECATED      - warn about code that will not work in future versions\n;                     of PHP\n; E_USER_DEPRECATED - user-generated deprecation warnings\n;\n; Common Values:\n;   E_ALL (Show all errors, warnings and notices including coding standards.)\n;   E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE  (Show all errors, except for notices)\n;   E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE & ~E_STRICT  (Show all errors, except for notices and coding standards warnings.)\n;   E_COMPILE_ERROR|E_RECOVERABLE_ERROR|E_ERROR|E_CORE_ERROR  (Show only errors)\n; Default Value: E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE & ~E_STRICT & ~E_DEPRECATED\n; Development Value: E_ALL\n; Production Value: E_ALL & ~E_DEPRECATED & ~E_STRICT\n; http://php.net/error-reporting\nerror_reporting = E_ALL\n\n; This directive controls whether or not and where PHP will output errors,\n; notices and warnings too. Error output is very useful during development, but\n; it could be very dangerous in production environments. Depending on the code\n; which is triggering the error, sensitive information could potentially leak\n; out of your application such as database usernames and passwords or worse.\n; It's recommended that errors be logged on production servers rather than\n; having the errors sent to STDOUT.\n; Possible Values:\n;   Off = Do not display any errors\n;   stderr = Display errors to STDERR (affects only CGI/CLI binaries!)\n;   On or stdout = Display errors to STDOUT\n; Default Value: On\n; Development Value: On\n; Production Value: Off\n; http://php.net/display-errors\ndisplay_errors = On\n\n; The display of errors which occur during PHP's startup sequence are handled\n; separately from display_errors. PHP's default behavior is to suppress those\n; errors from clients. Turning the display of startup errors on can be useful in\n; debugging configuration problems. But, it's strongly recommended that you\n; leave this setting off on production servers.\n; Default Value: Off\n; Development Value: On\n; Production Value: Off\n; http://php.net/display-startup-errors\ndisplay_startup_errors = Off\n\n; Besides displaying errors, PHP can also log errors to locations such as a\n; server-specific log, STDERR, or a location specified by the error_log\n; directive found below. While errors should not be displayed on productions\n; servers they should still be monitored and logging is a great way to do that.\n; Default Value: Off\n; Development Value: On\n; Production Value: On\n; http://php.net/log-errors\nlog_errors = Off\n\n; Set maximum length of log_errors. In error_log information about the source is\n; added. The default is 1024 and 0 allows to not apply any maximum length at all.\n; http://php.net/log-errors-max-len\nlog_errors_max_len = 1024\n\n; Do not log repeated messages. Repeated errors must occur in same file on same\n; line unless ignore_repeated_source is set true.\n; http://php.net/ignore-repeated-errors\nignore_repeated_errors = Off\n\n; Ignore source of message when ignoring repeated messages. When this setting\n; is On you will not log errors with repeated messages from different files or\n; source lines.\n; http://php.net/ignore-repeated-source\nignore_repeated_source = Off\n\n; If this parameter is set to Off, then memory leaks will not be shown (on\n; stdout or in the log). This has only effect in a debug compile, and if\n; error reporting includes E_WARNING in the allowed list\n; http://php.net/report-memleaks\nreport_memleaks = On\n\n; This setting is on by default.\n;report_zend_debug = 0\n\n; Store the last error/warning message in $php_errormsg (boolean). Setting this value\n; to On can assist in debugging and is appropriate for development servers. It should\n; however be disabled on production servers.\n; Default Value: Off\n; Development Value: On\n; Production Value: Off\n; http://php.net/track-errors\ntrack_errors = On\n\n; Turn off normal error reporting and emit XML-RPC error XML\n; http://php.net/xmlrpc-errors\n;xmlrpc_errors = 0\n\n; An XML-RPC faultCode\n;xmlrpc_error_number = 0\n\n; When PHP displays or logs an error, it has the capability of formatting the\n; error message as HTML for easier reading. This directive controls whether\n; the error message is formatted as HTML or not.\n; Note: This directive is hardcoded to Off for the CLI SAPI\n; Default Value: On\n; Development Value: On\n; Production value: On\n; http://php.net/html-errors\nhtml_errors = On\n\n; If html_errors is set to On *and* docref_root is not empty, then PHP\n; produces clickable error messages that direct to a page describing the error\n; or function causing the error in detail.\n; You can download a copy of the PHP manual from http://php.net/docs\n; and change docref_root to the base URL of your local copy including the\n; leading '/'. You must also specify the file extension being used including\n; the dot. PHP's default behavior is to leave these settings empty, in which\n; case no links to documentation are generated.\n; Note: Never use this feature for production boxes.\n; http://php.net/docref-root\n; Examples\n;docref_root = \"/phpmanual/\"\n\n; http://php.net/docref-ext\n;docref_ext = .html\n\n; String to output before an error message. PHP's default behavior is to leave\n; this setting blank.\n; http://php.net/error-prepend-string\n; Example:\n;error_prepend_string = \"<span style='color: #ff0000'>\"\n\n; String to output after an error message. PHP's default behavior is to leave\n; this setting blank.\n; http://php.net/error-append-string\n; Example:\n;error_append_string = \"</span>\"\n\n; Log errors to specified file. PHP's default behavior is to leave this value\n; empty.\n; http://php.net/error-log\n; Example:\n;error_log = php_errors.log\n; Log errors to syslog (Event Log on NT, not valid in Windows 95).\n;error_log = syslog\n\n;windows.show_crt_warning\n; Default value: 0\n; Development value: 0\n; Production value: 0\n\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;\n; Data Handling ;\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;\n\n; The separator used in PHP generated URLs to separate arguments.\n; PHP's default setting is \"&\".\n; http://php.net/arg-separator.output\n; Example:\n;arg_separator.output = \"&amp;\"\n\n; List of separator(s) used by PHP to parse input URLs into variables.\n; PHP's default setting is \"&\".\n; NOTE: Every character in this directive is considered as separator!\n; http://php.net/arg-separator.input\n; Example:\n;arg_separator.input = \";&\"\n\n; This directive determines which super global arrays are registered when PHP\n; starts up. G,P,C,E & S are abbreviations for the following respective super\n; globals: GET, POST, COOKIE, ENV and SERVER. There is a performance penalty\n; paid for the registration of these arrays and because ENV is not as commonly\n; used as the others, ENV is not recommended on productions servers. You\n; can still get access to the environment variables through getenv() should you\n; need to.\n; Default Value: \"EGPCS\"\n; Development Value: \"GPCS\"\n; Production Value: \"GPCS\";\n; http://php.net/variables-order\nvariables_order = \"GPCS\"\n\n; This directive determines which super global data (G,P,C,E & S) should\n; be registered into the super global array REQUEST. If so, it also determines\n; the order in which that data is registered. The values for this directive are\n; specified in the same manner as the variables_order directive, EXCEPT one.\n; Leaving this value empty will cause PHP to use the value set in the\n; variables_order directive. It does not mean it will leave the super globals\n; array REQUEST empty.\n; Default Value: None\n; Development Value: \"GP\"\n; Production Value: \"GP\"\n; http://php.net/request-order\nrequest_order = \"GP\"\n\n; This directive determines whether PHP registers $argv & $argc each time it\n; runs. $argv contains an array of all the arguments passed to PHP when a script\n; is invoked. $argc contains an integer representing the number of arguments\n; that were passed when the script was invoked. These arrays are extremely\n; useful when running scripts from the command line. When this directive is\n; enabled, registering these variables consumes CPU cycles and memory each time\n; a script is executed. For performance reasons, this feature should be disabled\n; on production servers.\n; Note: This directive is hardcoded to On for the CLI SAPI\n; Default Value: On\n; Development Value: Off\n; Production Value: Off\n; http://php.net/register-argc-argv\nregister_argc_argv = Off\n\n; When enabled, the ENV, REQUEST and SERVER variables are created when they're\n; first used (Just In Time) instead of when the script starts. If these\n; variables are not used within a script, having this directive on will result\n; in a performance gain. The PHP directive register_argc_argv must be disabled\n; for this directive to have any affect.\n; http://php.net/auto-globals-jit\nauto_globals_jit = On\n\n; Whether PHP will read the POST data.\n; This option is enabled by default.\n; Most likely, you won't want to disable this option globally.
